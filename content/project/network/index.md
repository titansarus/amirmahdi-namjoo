title: Computer Networks Course Project (P2P Netowrk)
summary: |2-
   * I have done a project implementing a Peer-to-Peer network using Python.


    * We did this project in a group of three. The project was about designing a **P2P network** with a binary tree structure. I worked on the core data structure, implemented different types of packets, and designed a simple P2P chat application based on this network.

    * The course in which we did this project was taught by **Dr. Mahdi Jafari Siavoshani** at Sharif University of Technology.
