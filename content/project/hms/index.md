title: Health Monitoring System
summary: |2-
   * Implemented and designed a Health Monitoring System.

    * Our product can measure a patient's SpO2, heart rate, body temperature, ECG, and Environmental Temperature and Humidity.
    
    * The project's core is based on Raspberry Pi 4 while using Arduino Uno as the ADC for some of the sensors. It features a complete monitoring system that can be viewed on smartphones, desktop monitors, and small monitors that could be connected to the Raspberry Pi. Our product can send the collected data to a central server for further analysis. It is noteworthy that our team designed the project's packaging, and its prototype was produced using a 3D printer.
    
    * Technologies used: **Raspberry Pi** and **Arduino** for the core hardware part, **React Native** for the front end of the application, **Django** for the server, and **Docker** as the containerization platform.

    * The course in which we did this project was taught by **Dr. Alireza Ejlali** and **Amin Fos'hati** at Sharif University of Technology. 

    * Teammates:
