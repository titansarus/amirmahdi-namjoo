title: PintOS
summary: |2-
    * I have done a multi-phase project on PintOS using C language.


    * We did this project in a group of four, in which we used remote pair programming techniques to design and work on the project together. I worked on all three phases of the project, including designing and implementing **User Programs**, **Threads**, and **FileSystem** on PintOS.

    * The Project was based on **Berkeley's CS162** course.

    * The course in which we did this project was taught by **Dr. Mehdi Kharrazi** at Sharif University of Technology.
