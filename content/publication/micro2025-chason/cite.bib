abstract = {High bandwidth memory (HBM) equipped sparse accelerators are emerging as a new class of accelerators that offer concurrent accesses to data and parallel execution to mitigate the memory bound behavior of sparse kernels. However, because of their underlying non-zero scheduling scheme, state-of-the-art HBM-based sparse accelerators (e.g., Serpens) suffer from high resource underutilization causing suboptimal performance, and inefficiency. To solve this challenge, we propose Chaso\v{n}, an HBM-based streaming accelerator for sparse kernels, specifically sparse matrix vector multiplication. Chaso\v{n} supports our novel non-zero scheduling scheme called Cross-HBM Channel out-of-order (OoO) Scheduling (CrHCS) to enable data migration across HBM channels and mitigate resource underutilization. We implement Chaso\v{n} on AMD Alveo U55C, achieving 301MHz clock frequency and evaluate it based on SuiteSparse and SNAP matrix collections. Chaso\v{n} improves the resource utilization and achieves up to 8 \texttimes{} , 20.33 \texttimes{} , 11.65 \texttimes{} , and 2.67 \texttimes{} performance improvement and 2.03 \texttimes{} , 34.72 \texttimes{} , 19.48 \texttimes{} , and 14.61 \texttimes{} better energy efficiency over Serpens, Nvidia RTX 4090, Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada, and Intel Core i9-11980HK, respectively. The source code of Chaso\v{n} is available at https://github.com/UbaidHunts/Chason.},
