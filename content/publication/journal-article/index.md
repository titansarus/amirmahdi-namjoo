abstract: With the rise of COVID-19 cases, all Sharif University of Technology undergraduate courses shifted toward a completely online paradigm, which caused new challenges in the education and assessment of students. Two of the most important courses for Computer Engineering students with lots of challenges due to the pandemic were Fundamentals of Programming and Advanced Object-Oriented Programming. To overcome these difficulties, we used various distance-learning techniques to enhance the quality of education.
